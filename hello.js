/*the code needs both parentheses to run as they 'wrap' the information within, 
/*  
Next, PLAY! 
Modify your code on line 7 to try to accomplish the tasks listed below:

   1. Change the message that is printed.
   2. Figure out what the parentheses do. Will the code work without them? It will not work without them, they wrap and sort of contain the information within.
   3. Remove one or both quotation marks. Do we need to include both opening and closing quote marks? Is there a difference between using a single or a double quote (' vs. ")? Must have both opening and closing quotation marks, seems to be a stylistic preference rather than big difference between them though.
   4. Remove the semi-colon, ;. 
   5. Print a number. (Bonus: Print two numbers added together).
   6. Print multiple messages one after the other.
   7. Print two messages on the same line.
   8. Print a message that contains quote marks, such as Quoth the Raven "Nevermore".
   9. Other. You choose!
